                        <p>Porsche has had its roots in racing ever since its inception in 1948 with the Type 356. Fast forwarding a bit, Porsche entered the scene of endurance racing in 1968, and with Ford and their P68 suffering from constant issues, Porsche with their 908's won. In 1969 after initial development of the 917 ended, drivers frequently stated how the car is very unstable at high speeds. At the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, British driver John Woolfe died as a result of wrecking his 917 on the first lap. Porsche's answer to the problem of the instability of their cars was (with John Wyer and his JWA Gulf Oil team) to tape aluminum sheets on the back of the 917 after removing the long tail portion of the rear. After doing so, drivers reported the car to be far more stable. These new 917K's had more downforce than the previous 917's, and Porsche supported many teams with assistance on their 917K's. Famous teams such as Martini Racing and Porsche Salzburg.   </p>
                        <p>Porsche's main competitor in this season was Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari actually sold half his share of Ferrari to FIAT in order to fund the building of the Ferrari 512 -- Ferrari's answer to the Porsche 917k, a rather dissapointing answer. During the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans, in the early portion of the race, most of the works Ferrari 512's wrecked each other. This resulted in the two contending Porsche teams -- the Wyer Gulf group and the Salzburg group, to be contending. However around 12 hours into the race all of the Gulf cars were out of the race due to troubles. The end result of the race was 7 total finishes, with the Salzburg red #23 livery 917K finishing first, followed by the Martini 917LH. </p>
                        <p>At the end of the 1970's race season, Porsche had won every race but one, with the 917K and the 908/03, with the 917K winning 7 of the 8 races it entered into. </p>
                        <p>An honorable mention to the 917 is that of the 1971 917/20 aka the "Pink Pig" or "Trufflehunter of Zuffenhausen". The car had a very wide body with sloping aerodynamics and a stricking "pig" related livery due to critics saying the car looked like a pig.The pink pig did run a few races and qualified for the 1971 24 Hours Of Le Mans, which it reached as high of 3rd place until it was wrecked due to brake failure. The 917/20 was harsher on its brakes compared to the 917K even though they had the same brake maintenance schedule as the 917K.</p>
